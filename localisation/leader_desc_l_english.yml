 POLITICS_RICARDO_JIMENEZ_OREAMUNO_DESC:0 "Riardo Jimenez Oreamuno was born on Cartago in 1859 as the son of former president Jesús Jiménez. He studied a Law degree on the University of Santo Tomás, of which he graduated in 1888. He was considered to possess great knowledge and advanced ideas. He became the President of Costa Rica three times (1910-1914, 1924-1928 and 1932-1936) and his governments were characterized by institutional stability and by the consolidation of the constitutional framework. However, his policy was characterized by personalist traits, which contributed to strengthening the Costa Rican regime in a purely presidential sense. Due to his authoritarian character, Jimenes Oreamuno was called the 'intellectual dictator'."
